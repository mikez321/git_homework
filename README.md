# GIT back!

This is just me practicing uploading git from the terminal into GitHub.

## The Steps:

1. Initialize a directory with GIT

* This is done by the command git Initialize

2.  Create, Modify, and Add files to staging to be commmitted

* Create files with touch

* Modify in whatever text editor.  I've been using Atom with the command atom . <file>

* Add with git add <file>

3.  Commit files

* "Commit often" and always use -m to add a notation.

* *The first should be "Initial Commit".  Following the initial commit, commits should be descriptive of what was done.  Capitalize the first letter, don't use punctuation, and keep under 50 characters.*

* Commit by git commit -m "notes"

4.  After linking to your new repository (steps that need to be practiced) Upload to GitHub

* Use git push -u origin master for initial push.

* Use git push origin master for subsequent pushes.

* Don't be lame.  Push it real good.


## And that's it. ##

Probably not.  I'm sure there's more to it, but its late, and there will be plenty of work to be done later.
